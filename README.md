Change branch to access them.


Current projects:
- **used cars**: regression on prices of used cars based
on several predictors such as mileage, year, engine size etc.
- **MNIST**: reaching over 97% accuracy on popular 70000 handwritten
digits dataset.

observation is a mobile, that has to be classified in a price range
